---

## Architecture Impact

### Before: Distributed MQTT Wrappers

```
apps/llm-worker/src/llm_worker/mqtt_client.py         (~250 lines)
apps/memory-worker/src/memory_worker/mqtt_client.py   (~200 lines)
apps/stt-worker/src/stt_worker/mqtt_utils.py          (206 lines)
apps/camera-service/src/camera_service/mqtt_client.py (100 lines)
[Each with slightly different implementations]
```

**Problems**:
- Duplicate reconnection logic (4 implementations)
- Inconsistent health monitoring (manual calls scattered)
- No heartbeat support
- No message deduplication
- Divergent error handling patterns
- High maintenance burden (fix bug 4 times)

### After: Centralized MQTTClient

```
packages/tars-core/src/tars/adapters/mqtt_client.py
  ├── Auto-reconnection (exponential backoff)
  ├── Health monitoring (auto-publish on connect/disconnect)
  ├── Heartbeat support (optional, configurable interval)
  ├── Message deduplication (TTL cache)
  ├── Subscription handlers (clean async pattern)
  └── Comprehensive tests (unit + integration + contract)
```

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth (one implementation)
- Consistent behavior across all services
- Centralized testing (test once, benefits all)
- Reduced maintenance burden (fix bug once)
- Feature parity (all services get new features automatically)

## Migration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Subscription Handler Services (Most Complex)

**Examples**: llm-worker, memory-worker, stt-worker, router, tts-worker, movement-service, wake-activation

**Migration Steps**:
1. Add `tars-core` dependency
2. Import `from tars.adapters.mqtt_client import MQTTClient`
3. Replace client instantiation with `MQTTClient(..., enable_health=True, enable_heartbeat=True)`
4. Convert message loops to subscription handlers:
   ```python
   # Before
   async with client.messages() as messages:
       async for msg in messages:
           if msg.topic == "llm/request":
               await handle_request(msg.payload)
   
   # After
   async def _handle_llm_request(self, payload: bytes) -> None:
       # Handler logic
       pass
   
   await client.add_subscription_handler("llm/request", self._handle_llm_request)
   ```
5. Remove manual health publishing calls
6. Update shutdown: `await client.shutdown()`
7. Delete old wrapper file
8. Update README with centralized client docs

**Time**: ~2-3 hours per service

### Pattern 2: Publisher-Only Services (Simplest)

**Examples**: camera-service, ui-web

**Migration Steps**:
1-3. Same as Pattern 1
4. Convert sync publish to async:
   ```python
   # Before
   self.mqtt.publish_frame(...)
   
   # After
   await self.mqtt.publish(topic, payload, qos=0)
   ```
5-8. Same as Pattern 1

**Time**: ~30 minutes per service

### Pattern 3: Mixed Services (Moderate Complexity)

**Examples**: router (routing + streaming), wake-activation (detection + fanout)

**Characteristics**:
- Both subscription handlers AND publishing logic
- Message transformation/routing
- Streaming patterns (accumulate + flush)

**Time**: ~1-2 hours per service

## Key Features of Centralized Client

### 1. Auto-Reconnection

**Implementation**:
- Exponential backoff (0.5s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 5s max)
- Configurable via `reconnect_min_delay` and `reconnect_max_delay`
- Session recovery (re-subscribe to all topics on reconnect)

**Benefits**:
- Survives broker restarts
- No manual reconnection logic needed
- Consistent across all services

### 2. Health Monitoring

**Implementation**:
- Auto-publishes to `system/health/{client_id}` (retained)
- Payload: `{ "ok": bool, "event": str, "timestamp": float }`
- Published on: connect, disconnect, errors
- Optional custom health check function

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated 50+ manual `publish_health()` calls across all services
- Consistent health reporting
- Centralized monitoring integration point

### 3. Heartbeat

**Implementation**:
- Optional (enable with `enable_heartbeat=True`)
- Publishes to `system/keepalive/{client_id}` every 5s (configurable)
- Payload: `{ "ok": true, "event": "hb", "ts": float }`

**Benefits**:
- Session presence monitoring
- Detect stale connections
- Watchdog integration point

### 4. Message Deduplication

**Implementation**:
- TTL cache (default 60s, configurable)
- Key: `(topic, message_id)`
- Prevents duplicate processing during reconnects

**Benefits**:
- Clean MQTT logs
- No duplicate LLM requests or TTS synthesis
- Idempotent message processing

### 5. Subscription Handlers

**Implementation**:
```python
async def handler(payload: bytes) -> None:
    # Handler logic
    pass

await client.add_subscription_handler("topic/pattern", handler)
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- No manual message loop management
- Easy to test (mock handlers)

## Documentation Standards

All service READMEs now include:

### 1. MQTT Client Architecture Section

**Template**:
```markdown
## MQTT Client Architecture

**Centralized Client**: Uses `tars.adapters.mqtt_client.MQTTClient` from `tars-core` package.

**Key Features**:
- Auto-reconnection with exponential backoff
- Health monitoring (auto-published)
- Heartbeat support
- Message deduplication
- Subscription handler pattern

**Handler Pattern**:
[Code example showing subscription handler]

**Health Integration**:
[Service-specific health details]

**Migration Benefits**:
[Quantified improvements]
```

### 2. Updated Directory Structures

**Before**:
```
├── service.py
└── mqtt_client.py  # MQTT client wrapper
```

**After**:
```
└── service.py      # Core logic (MQTT lifecycle, handler registration)
```

### 3. Architecture Sections

Updated to reflect centralized client usage:
- No more references to local `mqtt_client.py`
- Document subscription handlers where applicable
- Explain health monitoring and heartbeat

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Coverage**: `packages/tars-core/tests/unit/`
- Connection lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)
- Health monitoring (auto-publish on events)
- Heartbeat (interval, payload)
- Message deduplication (TTL cache)
- Configuration (params, validation)
- Publishing (topics, QoS, payloads)
- Subscription handlers (registration, dispatch)

**Total**: ~15 test files, ~150 test cases

### Integration Tests

**Coverage**: `packages/tars-core/tests/integration/`
- End-to-end message flow
- Reconnection scenarios (broker restart)
- Health status lifecycle

**Total**: ~3 test files, ~20 test cases

### Contract Tests

**Coverage**: `packages/tars-core/tests/contract/`
- Envelope schema validation
- Health payload schema
- Heartbeat payload schema

**Total**: ~1 test file, ~10 test cases

### Service-Specific Tests

**Required for Each Service**:
- [ ] Subscription handlers work correctly
- [ ] Health status updates on connect/disconnect
- [ ] Heartbeat messages published (if enabled)
- [ ] Reconnection survives broker restart
- [ ] No duplicate message processing

**Status**: T075 - Integration testing (pending)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Start with Simple Services

**Approach**:
- Phase 6: Simple services first (stt-worker, router, tts-worker, etc.)
- Phase 7: Complex services last (llm-worker, memory-worker, camera-service)

**Rationale**:
- Build confidence with easy wins
- Refine migration pattern on simple cases
- Discover edge cases early

### 2. Documentation Is Critical

**Problem**: After migrations, READMEs referenced deleted files (mqtt_client.py)

**Solution**: T072 - Update all READMEs immediately after code changes

**Lesson**: Documentation should be part of migration PR, not separate task

### 3. Orphaned Files Are Sneaky

**Problem**: T073 - Found orphaned `mqtt_utils.py` in stt-worker (206 lines)

**Root Cause**: Updated imports, forgot to delete old file

**Solution**: Add "delete old wrapper" to migration checklist

**Lesson**: Always `grep` for imports AND file existence

### 4. Publish-Only Services Are Simplest

**Observation**: camera-service took 30 min, llm-worker took 2 hours

**Reason**: No subscription handlers, no message routing, just async publish

**Lesson**: Prioritize by complexity, not alphabetically

### 5. Health Auto-Publishing Is Powerful

**Impact**: Eliminated 50+ manual health calls across all services

**Benefit**: Consistent behavior, no forgotten calls, automatic error reporting

**Lesson**: Auto-publish patterns reduce cognitive load and bugs

### 6. Deduplication Prevents Chaos

**Scenario**: MQTT reconnect → duplicate messages → double LLM requests

**Solution**: TTL cache with `(topic, message_id)` key

**Benefit**: Clean logs, predictable behavior, idempotent processing

**Lesson**: Always assume messages can be duplicated

### 7. Async Shutdown Requires Care

**Problem**: Signal handlers can't directly `await`

**Solution**: `asyncio.create_task(shutdown())` pattern

**Lesson**: Async entry points need special shutdown handling

---

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Centralized vs. Service-Specific Wrappers

**Choice**: Centralized in `tars-core`

**Rationale**:
- Single source of truth
- Consistent behavior across services
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Test once, benefit all services

**Trade-offs**:
- Adds dependency on `tars-core` for all services
- Breaking changes to MQTTClient affect all services

**Mitigation**:
- Semantic versioning for tars-core
- Comprehensive test suite prevents regressions
- Migration guide for breaking changes

### Decision 2: Subscription Handlers vs. Message Loops

**Choice**: Subscription handlers (async callbacks)

**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to test (mock handlers)
- No manual loop management
- Scales to many subscriptions

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires converting existing loop code
- Slightly more boilerplate (handler functions)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear migration pattern documented
- Examples in all service READMEs

### Decision 3: Health Auto-Publishing vs. Manual Calls

**Choice**: Auto-publishing on connect/disconnect/errors

**Rationale**:
- Eliminates 50+ manual calls
- Consistent behavior (no forgotten calls)
- Reduces cognitive load

**Trade-offs**:
- Less control over health messages
- Can't customize event strings easily

**Mitigation**:
- Support optional custom health check function
- Default behavior covers 95% of cases

### Decision 4: Keep Heartbeat Optional

**Choice**: Heartbeat is opt-in (`enable_heartbeat=True`)

**Rationale**:
- Not all services need session presence monitoring
- Reduces MQTT traffic for simple services
- Easy to enable when needed

**Trade-offs**:
- Not enabled by default (must opt-in)

**Mitigation**:
- Documented in migration guide
- Example in README templates

---

## Services NOT Migrated (By Design)

### 1. mcp-bridge

**Status**: Not migrated (Pure MCP server)

**Reason**:
- MCP servers should NOT have MQTT code
- Pure tool providers (return `mqtt_publish` directives)
- llm-worker `ToolExecutor` handles MQTT publishing

**Future**: Never migrate (architectural principle)

### 2. ui (Tkinter)

**Status**: Not migrated (Simple publish-only)

**Reason**:
- Simple Tkinter app with basic MQTT publishing
- Low priority (not part of voice loop)
- Works fine with simple paho-mqtt usage

**Future**: Migrate if needs health monitoring or advanced features

### 3. ESP32 Firmware

**Status**: Not migrated (Different platform)

**Reason**:
- MicroPython (umqtt library, not asyncio)
- Completely different stack
- Platform constraints prevent using Python asyncio

**Future**: Never migrate (platform incompatible)
