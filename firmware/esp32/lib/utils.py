"""
Cross-platform utility functions for ESP32 MicroPython firmware.

Provides compatibility shims for:
- Time functions (sleep_ms, ticks_ms, ticks_diff)
- File I/O (with UTF-8 encoding fallback)

These utilities work on both MicroPython (ESP32) and CPython (development/testing).

        On MicroPython, this wraps around periodically.
