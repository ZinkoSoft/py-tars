# Specification Quality Checklist: Convert ui-web to Vue.js TypeScript Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-17  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)  
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - All criteria met

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - Technology choices moved to Assumptions section
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - User stories emphasize extensibility, developer productivity, and feature parity
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Requirements focus on capabilities, not implementation
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are concrete and actionable
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each FR can be verified through testing
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All SC items include specific metrics (time, size, performance, developer velocity)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic - No framework-specific language in success criteria
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - WebSocket disconnection, high-frequency messages, component failures, mobile viewports, concurrent users
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Migration preserves existing features, focuses on architecture improvement
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Assumptions section documents build tools, framework choices, backend stability

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - FR-001 through FR-015 map to user story acceptance scenarios
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - 6 prioritized user stories from P1 (chat) to P3 (specific features)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - SC-001 through SC-008 align with user stories and FRs
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Implementation details isolated to Assumptions section

## Validation Notes

**Iteration 1**: Initial spec contained implementation details in functional requirements and success criteria:
- FR-001: Mentioned "Vue.js" → Changed to "modern single-page application"
- FR-002: Mentioned "FastAPI" → Changed to "backend"
- FR-004: Mentioned "Vue component" → Changed to "the interface"
- FR-010: Mentioned "TypeScript" → Changed to "type safety"
- SC-004: Mentioned "Vue application" → Changed to "application"
- SC-005: Mentioned "TypeScript code" and "`any` types" → Changed to "application code" and "runtime type errors"
- Key Entities: Mentioned "Vue Component" → Changed to "UI Component"
- Key Entities: Mentioned "FastAPI backend" → Changed to "backend server"

**Iteration 2**: ✅ All issues resolved. Spec is technology-agnostic while maintaining clarity and testability.

## Ready for Next Phase

✅ **Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`**

No clarifications needed - all requirements are concrete with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions.
