## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - MVP functionality
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run parallel with US1 (different files)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 (builds on REST API) - Sequential after US1
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run parallel with US1/US2 (different files)
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US1 (needs core CRUD) - Sequential after US1
- **User Story 6 (Phase 8)**: Depends on US1 (needs core CRUD) - Can run parallel with US5 (different files)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### Within Each Phase

- Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, no conflicts)
- Tasks without [P] must run sequentially (same file or direct dependencies)
- Foundational phase is CRITICAL PATH - prioritize completion

### Parallel Opportunities

**Setup (Phase 1)**: T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can all run in parallel

**Foundational (Phase 2)**: T011, T012, T013 (models) can run together; T032, T033, T034, T035 (tests) can run together

**User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: T047, T048, T049 (REST endpoints) can run in parallel; T054, T055, T056, T057, T058, T059 (UI components) can run in parallel; T070, T071 (tests) can run in parallel

**Across Stories**: US2 and US4 can run in parallel with US1 (different files)

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch all model files together:
Task T011: "Create types.py with enums"
Task T012: "Create models.py with Pydantic models"
Task T013: "Create mqtt_models.py with MQTT schemas"

# Launch all test files together:
Task T032: "Create test_crypto.py"
Task T033: "Create test_precedence.py"
Task T034: "Create test_database.py"
Task T035: "Create test_mqtt_schemas.py"
```
