# Tasks: Standardize MQTT Topics

**Feature**: Standardize MQTT Topics and Contracts  
**Branch**: `copilot/standardize-mqtt-topics`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-standardize-mqtt-topics/`

**Status**: Phase 3 Complete - All services migrated to typed contracts

**Current Checkpoint**: Phase 3 complete. All 9 service groups updated to use topic constants from tars-core. Ready for Phase 4 (Integration Testing and Documentation).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Domain] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different domains/files, no dependencies)
- **[Domain]**: Which service domain this task belongs to
- All paths are absolute from repository root

## Organization

Tasks are organized by phase and domain. Each domain (stt, tts, llm, etc.) can be worked on independently after Phase 1 is complete.

---

## Phase 4: Integration Testing and Documentation

**Purpose**: Verify end-to-end flows and document the system

### Integration Tests

- [X] T100 Create `/tests/integration/test_mqtt_topic_standards.py` ✓ DONE
- [ ] T101 Test STT → Router → LLM → TTS flow with correlation ID propagation [Use `message_id` field]
- [ ] T102 Test wake event flow with proper message validation [Wake uses `type` field]
- [ ] T103 Test memory query/results flow [Use `message_id` field]
- [ ] T104 Test movement command flow
- [ ] T105 Test camera capture flow
- [ ] T106 Test MCP request/response flow [Use LLM tool topics with dots: llm/tool.call.request]
- [ ] T107 Test error handling for malformed messages
- [ ] T108 Test QoS delivery guarantees
- [ ] T109 Verify all integration tests pass

**Note**: Integration tests created. Discovered:
- Contracts use `message_id` (not `correlation_id`) - tests need update
- Tool topics use dots: `llm/tool.call.request` (not slashes `llm/tool/call/request`) - acceptable variation
- WakeEvent requires `type` field - tests need update
- Most tests fail due to field name mismatch but structure is correct

### Documentation

- [X] T110 Create comprehensive topic registry in `/specs/003-standardize-mqtt-topics/topic-registry.md` ✓ DONE
- [X] T111 Document breaking change policy in `/specs/003-standardize-mqtt-topics/breaking-changes.md` ✓ DONE
- [ ] T112 Update each service README with:
  - Topics published (with contracts)
  - Topics subscribed (with contracts)
  - Correlation ID strategy
  - QoS levels used
- [ ] T113 Update main `/README.md` with link to topic registry
- [ ] T114 Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with MQTT standardization patterns
- [X] T115 Create migration guide in `/specs/003-standardize-mqtt-topics/migration-guide.md` ✓ DONE (already exists)
- [ ] T116 Update constitution if needed based on learnings

### Validation and Completion

- [ ] T117 Run full system test: `docker compose -f ops/compose.yml up`
- [ ] T118 Verify all services start without errors
- [ ] T119 Verify message flows work end-to-end
- [ ] T120 Verify correlation IDs propagate correctly
- [ ] T121 Run `make check` in all app directories
- [ ] T122 Create completion report in `/specs/003-standardize-mqtt-topics/COMPLETION_REPORT.md`

**Checkpoint**: ✅ All tasks complete, system validated, documentation finalized

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Phase 1 (Audit)**: No dependencies - understanding current state
2. **Phase 2 (Contracts)**: Depends on Phase 1 completion
3. **Phase 3 (Services)**: Depends on Phase 2 completion for domain-specific contracts
4. **Phase 4 (Testing/Docs)**: Depends on Phase 3 completion

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Phase 1**: All tasks run sequentially (single audit)

**Phase 2**: 
- System, camera, and review tasks for different domains marked [P] can run in parallel
- Each domain (stt, tts, llm, wake, memory, mcp) is independent

**Phase 3**:
- All service updates can run in parallel after Phase 2
- Each service is independent
- UI and ui-web marked [P] explicitly

**Phase 4**:
- Integration tests run after all services updated
- Documentation tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Validation must run last

### Within Each Service Update

Standard sequence:
1. Import contracts from tars-core
2. Replace string literals with constants
3. Add Pydantic validation
4. Add correlation IDs
5. Update logging
6. Set QoS levels
7. Test

---

## Success Criteria

Standardization complete when:

1. ✅ All topics have Pydantic v2 contracts in tars-core
2. ✅ All services use topic constants (no string literals)
3. ✅ All messages include correlation IDs
4. ✅ QoS levels match constitutional standards
5. ✅ All services pass `make check`
6. ✅ Integration tests prove end-to-end flows work
7. ✅ Topic registry documents all topics
8. ✅ Service READMEs document MQTT contracts
9. ✅ Breaking change policy documented
10. ✅ Migration guide available for future changes

---

## Notes

- **[P] markers**: Tasks that can run in parallel (different domains/services)
- **[Domain] labels**: Track which service domain each task belongs to
- **Validation**: Test after each service update before moving to next
- **Git workflow**: Commit after logical groups (e.g., after each service)
- **Constitution compliance**: All changes must follow Event-Driven Architecture principles
- **Backward compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing message formats
- **Type safety**: Pydantic models with `extra="forbid"` for all contracts

---

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1 day (audit and document)
- **Phase 2**: 2-3 days (create missing contracts and tests)
- **Phase 3**: 3-5 days (update all services)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (integration tests and documentation)

**Total**: 8-12 days (can be reduced with parallel work)

---

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with non-critical services (UI, camera) before core services (router, stt, tts, llm)
- Test each service independently before integration
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Commit frequently for easy rollback
- Document any discovered issues or architectural concerns
- Update constitution if patterns need adjustment
