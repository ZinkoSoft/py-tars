- ✅ **spec.md** - Detailed technical standards (13,427 characters)
- ✅ **tasks.md** - 122 implementation tasks organized by phase (13,710 characters)
- ✅ **topic-inventory.md** - Complete audit of 28 MQTT topics (11,906 characters)
- ✅ **migration-guide.md** - Step-by-step service migration instructions (9,987 characters)
- ✅ **README.md** - Navigation and quick start guide (6,068 characters)
- ✅ **summary.md** - This document

**Total Documentation**: ~55,000 characters of comprehensive specification

### 2. Phase 1: Audit and Documentation (COMPLETE ✅)

Tasks T001-T006 completed:

- ✅ Inventoried all 28 MQTT topics across all services

- [ ] mcp-bridge (7 tasks)

**Priority 3 - UI Services** (8 tasks):
- [ ] ui (4 tasks)
- [ ] ui-web (4 tasks)

**Per-Service Tasks**:
1. Import contracts from tars-core
2. Replace string literals with constants
3. Use Pydantic models for validation

### Short-term (Week 4)

4. **Supporting Services**:
   - Migrate wake-activation
   - Migrate memory-worker
   - Migrate camera-service (use new camera contracts)
   - Migrate mcp-bridge

5. **UI Services**:
   - Migrate ui
   - Migrate ui-web

6. **Integration Testing**:

   - Create topic registry
   - Write completion report

## Estimated Remaining Effort

**Phase 3 (Service Updates)**: 3-5 days
- Core services (router, stt, tts, llm): 1-2 days
- Supporting services: 1-2 days
- UI services: 0.5-1 day

**Phase 4 (Testing & Docs)**: 2-3 days
- Integration tests: 1-2 days
- Documentation: 1 day

**Total Remaining**: 5-8 days (can be parallelized with multiple developers)

## Conclusion

The foundation for MQTT topic standardization is **complete and ready for use**:

✅ **Specifications are comprehensive** - All standards documented  
✅ **Contracts are complete** - All topics have Pydantic models  
✅ **Constants are defined** - 22 new topic constants added  
✅ **Camera domain created** - 3 models with 24 passing tests  
✅ **Migration guide ready** - Step-by-step instructions available  
✅ **Zero breaking changes** - 100% backward compatible  
✅ **Constitutional compliance** - Follows all principles  

The remaining work (Phases 3-4) is well-defined, documented, and can proceed incrementally without risk. Each service can be migrated independently, tested, and deployed.

**The spec is production-ready** and provides clear guidance for completing the standardization effort.
