# Tasks: Adopt TARS AI Movement System Updates

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-adopt-tars-ai/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/movement-presets.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Hardware integration tests required (cannot be fully automated). Contract tests for movement presets are included.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

- [x] T012 [US1] Add defensive errno 121 detection in `_set_pwm_with_retry()`: check `hasattr(e, 'errno') and e.errno == 121` OR `"Remote I/O" in str(e)` in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T013 [US1] Add retry logging: `print(f"I2C retry {attempt+1}/{MAX_RETRIES} on ch{channel}")` in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T014 [US1] Add `await asyncio.sleep(0.05)` between retry attempts in `_set_pwm_with_retry()` in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`

- [x] T021 [US2] Update `move_to_safe_positions()` to use `await self._set_pwm_with_retry()` in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py` (N/A - method doesn't exist)

### Contract Testing for User Story 2

- [x] T022 [P] [US2] Create `tests/firmware/esp32_test/test_pwm_conversion.py` with test cases for 12-bit PWM values (0, 2047, 4095) - VERIFY NO CONVERSION NEEDED

- [x] T030 [US3] Ensure `active_sequence` is set in `try` block and cleared in `finally` block for guaranteed cleanup in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T031 [US3] Verify `disable_all_servos()` is called in `finally` block to reset movement state in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py` (called in try block before finally)

### Hardware Testing for User Story 3

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T036 [US4] Update `move_servo_smooth()` to update `self.positions[channel] = position` DURING gradual movement loop (not just at end) in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T037 [US4] Ensure position update happens INSIDE `async with self.locks[channel]:` context in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T038 [US4] Add position tracking to `_set_pwm_with_retry()` calls: update `self.positions[channel]` after successful PWM write in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py`
- [x] T039 [US4] Add debug logging (optional): `print(f"Position updated: ch{channel} = {position}")` in `firmware/esp32_test/servo_controller.py` (not added - would be too verbose)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase (Phase 2) completion
  - User Story 1 (P1) ‚Üí User Story 2 (P1): Can run in parallel (different methods)
  - User Story 3 (P2) ‚Üí User Story 4 (P2): Can run in parallel (different concerns)
  - User Story 5 (P3): Can run in parallel with P2 stories (different file: movement_presets.py)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (US1)**: Depends only on Foundational (Phase 2) - NO dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (US2)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) AND uses `_set_pwm_with_retry()` from US1 ‚Üí Should implement AFTER US1 or in parallel if coordinated
- **User Story 3 (US3)**: Depends only on Foundational (Phase 2) - uses existing `active_sequence` ‚Üí Can run in parallel with US1/US2
- **User Story 4 (US4)**: Depends only on Foundational (Phase 2) - modifies position tracking ‚Üí Can run in parallel with US1/US2/US3

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (P1 Stories Only)

1. **Phase 1**: Setup (T001-T004)
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational (T005-T008) ‚Üê BLOCKS everything
3. **Phase 3**: User Story 1 (T009-T017) ‚Üê Hardware initialization
4. **Phase 4**: User Story 2 (T018-T027) ‚Üê PWM retry logic
5. **Phase 8**: Regression Testing (T056-T062) ‚Üê Validate P1 stories
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test P1 functionality on hardware
7. Deploy if ready or continue to P2/P3 stories

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1 + Phase 2): Setup + retry infrastructure
2. **P1 Increment** (Phase 3 + Phase 4): Hardware init + PWM retry ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
3. **P2 Increment** (Phase 5 + Phase 6): Movement protection + position tracking ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. **P3 Increment** (Phase 7): Updated gait ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. **Final** (Phase 8 + Phase 9): Regression testing + documentation

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Single Developer Strategy (Sequential by Priority)

1. Setup (Phase 1)
2. Foundational (Phase 2)
3. User Story 1 (Phase 3) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate
4. User Story 2 (Phase 4) ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Validate

**Suggested MVP Scope**: 
- Phase 1 (Setup) + Phase 2 (Foundational) + Phase 3 (US1) + Phase 4 (US2) = P1 priorities only
- Delivers: Reliable hardware initialization + retry logic (28 tasks total)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files or independent operations, no dependencies
- [Story] label (US1-US5) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story is independently testable using scenarios from `quickstart.md`
- Hardware tests require physical ESP32 setup - cannot be fully automated
- Contract tests validate data structures - can run in Python without hardware
- Verify all async functions use `await` for sleep/lock operations (async-first critical)
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., after each user story phase)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
