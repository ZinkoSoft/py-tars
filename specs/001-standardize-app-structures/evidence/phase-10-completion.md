# Phase 10 Completion Report: LLM Worker Migration

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Tasks Completed**: 14/14 (100%)

## Summary

Successfully migrated the LLM Worker service from flat structure to src/ layout with organized tests, standardized tooling, and Docker build optimization.

## Completed Tasks

### T152-T155: Structure Migration ✅
- ✅ Analyzed and documented current structure
- ✅ Created `src/llm_worker/` directory
- ✅ Moved all modules including `providers/` and `handlers/` subpackages
- ✅ Verified `__main__.py` entry point exists

### T156-T157: Test Organization ✅
- ✅ Organized tests into `unit/`, `integration/`, `contract/` subdirectories
- ✅ Created test structure for providers and handlers
- ✅ Created `conftest.py` with shared fixtures and MQTT client mocks

### T158-T161: Configuration & Tooling ✅
- ✅ Updated `pyproject.toml` for src/ layout with proper package configuration
- ✅ Created `Makefile` with standard targets (fmt, lint, test, check)
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with comprehensive installation and development instructions
- ✅ Created `.env.example` with all required environment variables

### T162: Testing & Validation ✅
```bash
$ source /home/james/git/py-tars/.venv/bin/activate
$ cd apps/llm-worker
$ pip install -e .
Successfully installed tars-llm-worker-0.1.0

$ pip install -e ".[dev]"
Successfully installed pytest pytest-asyncio pytest-cov pytest-mock...

$ make check
# Format check

# Tests

======================== 12 passed in 0.45s =========================
Coverage: 49%
```

### T163-T164: Docker Build ✅
```bash
$ docker build -f docker/specialized/llm-worker.Dockerfile -t tars/llm-worker:test .
[+] Building 11.2s (19/19) FINISHED
 => => naming to docker.io/tars/llm-worker:test
✅ Build succeeded!
```

**Dockerfile Changes**:
- Updated for src/ layout with `PYTHONPATH="/workspace/apps/llm-worker/src:${PYTHONPATH}"`
- Simplified MCP configuration (deferred to runtime via volume mount)
- Changed `MCP_CONFIG_FILE=/workspace/config/mcp-servers.json`
- Removed build-time MCP bridge complexity

### T165: Documentation ✅
- ✅ Created comprehensive `structure-after.txt` with benefits and test results

## Key Improvements

1. **Import Safety**: src/ layout prevents accidental imports from test code
2. **Test Organization**: Clear separation of unit/integration/contract tests
3. **Standardized Workflow**: Makefile targets match other services
4. **Type Safety**: mypy configuration ready (currently permissive to preserve existing behavior)
5. **Docker Optimization**: Cached layers, simplified MCP handling
6. **Environment Config**: 12-factor compliance with `.env.example`
7. **Test Coverage Baseline**: 49% coverage established for future improvement

## Test Results Summary

| Test Type | Count | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Contract Tests | 3 | ✅ PASS |
| Integration Tests | 1 | ✅ PASS |
| Unit Tests (service) | 2 | ✅ PASS |
| Unit Tests (providers) | 6 | ✅ PASS |
| **Total** | **12** | **✅ ALL PASSING** |

## Docker Build Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Build Time | 11.2s |
| Layers | 19/19 |
| Cached Layers | 13/19 |
| Image Size | ~450MB |
| Status | ✅ SUCCESS |

## Files Changed

### Created
- `apps/llm-worker/src/llm_worker/` (moved from root)
- `apps/llm-worker/tests/unit/` (organized structure)
- `apps/llm-worker/tests/integration/`
- `apps/llm-worker/tests/contract/`
- `apps/llm-worker/tests/conftest.py`
- `apps/llm-worker/Makefile`
- `apps/llm-worker/.env.example`
- `specs/001-standardize-app-structures/evidence/llm-worker-structure-after.txt`

### Modified
- `apps/llm-worker/pyproject.toml` (src/ layout configuration)
- `apps/llm-worker/README.md` (comprehensive rewrite)
- `docker/specialized/llm-worker.Dockerfile` (src/ layout + simplified MCP)

### Removed
- `apps/llm-worker/llm_worker/` (moved to src/)
- `apps/llm-worker/tests/*.py` (reorganized into subdirectories)

## Integration Verification

The LLM worker is ready for integration testing with:
- ✅ MQTT message contracts validated (contract tests)
- ✅ Provider interfaces tested (unit tests)
- ✅ Service initialization tested (integration tests)
- ✅ Docker build successful
- ✅ Environment configuration documented

## Next Phase

**Phase 11: STT Worker Migration** (T166-T179)
- Goal: Migrate stt-worker (audio input service)
- Priority: P8
- Independent Test: `cd apps/stt-worker && make check && docker compose build stt-worker`

## Notes

- **Mypy**: Currently configured with permissive settings to avoid breaking existing code. Future improvement: enable strict mode and fix type issues.
- **MCP Configuration**: Moved from build-time generation to runtime volume mount for flexibility. Config expected at `/workspace/config/mcp-servers.json`.
- **Test Coverage**: 49% baseline established. Areas for improvement: service.py (47% → target 80%), __main__.py (0% → add CLI tests).
