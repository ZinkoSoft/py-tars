# Tasks: Standardize App Folder Structures

**Feature**: Standardize App Folder Structures  
**Branch**: `001-standardize-app-structures`  
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-standardize-app-structures/`

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [App] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different apps/files, no dependencies)
- **[App]**: Which app this task belongs to
- All paths are absolute from repository root

## Organization

Tasks are organized by app migration. Each app migration is treated as an independent "story" that can be completed and validated independently. Apps are ordered by migration priority (low to high risk).

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Create reusable templates and shared tooling

- [X] T001 Verify templates exist in `/specs/001-standardize-app-structures/contracts/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

1. **Phase 1 (Setup)**: No dependencies - creates templates/tools
2. **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Depends on Phase 1 - establishes standards
3. **Phases 3-13 (App Migrations)**: All depend on Phase 2 completion
   - Apps can be migrated in parallel if multiple developers
   - Or sequentially following priority order (wake-activation ‚Üí router)
4. **Phase 14 (Polish)**: Depends on all app migrations being complete

### App Migration Independence

Each app migration (Phases 3-13) is **completely independent**:
- wake-activation (Phase 3): MVP - smallest app, good practice
- camera-service (Phase 4): Needs most work
- ui/ui-web (Phase 5): Both can be done in parallel
- voice (Phase 6): Independent
- movement-service (Phase 7): Independent
- mcp-bridge/mcp-server (Phase 8): Both can be done in parallel
- memory-worker (Phase 9): Independent
- tts-worker (Phase 10): Independent
- llm-worker (Phase 11): Independent
- stt-worker (Phase 12): Independent
- router (Phase 13): Most critical, do last

### Within Each App Migration

Standard sequence for each app:
1. Analyze current structure
2. Create new directory structure (src/, tests/)
3. Move files to new locations
4. Create configuration files (pyproject.toml, Makefile, README, .env.example)
5. Test installation and validation
6. Update Docker configuration
7. Verify Docker build
8. Document changes

### Parallel Opportunities

**During Setup/Foundational (Phases 1-2)**:
- T003 and T006 can run in parallel with T004-T005

**During App Migrations (Phases 3-13)**:
- With multiple developers, all apps can be migrated in parallel after Phase 2
- Within Phase 5: T040-T053 (ui) and T054-T067 (ui-web) marked [P]
- Within Phase 8: T096-T109 (mcp-bridge) and T110-T123 (mcp-server) - mcp-server tasks marked [P]

**During Polish (Phase 14)**:
- T197, T198, T199, T200, T201 all marked [P] (different files)

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential MVP Approach (Single Developer)

Migrate one app at a time in priority order:

1. **Phase 1-2**: Setup + Foundation (1-2 hours)
2. **Phase 3**: wake-activation (30-60 min) ‚Üí **TEST & VALIDATE**
3. **Phase 4**: camera-service (2-3 hours) ‚Üí **TEST & VALIDATE**
4. Continue through Phases 5-13 in order
5. **Phase 14**: Polish and integration

Estimated total time: 15-25 hours

### Parallel Team Approach (Multiple Developers)

After Phase 1-2 completion:

- **Developer A**: Phases 3-5 (wake-activation, camera-service, ui services)
- **Developer B**: Phases 6-9 (voice, movement, MCP, memory)
- **Developer C**: Phases 10-13 (tts, llm, stt, router)

Estimated time: 5-8 hours with 3 developers

### Incremental Validation

After each app migration:
1. Run `make check` in app directory
2. Test Docker build
3. Run app standalone with MQTT broker
4. Test with full stack (optional but recommended)
5. Commit changes before moving to next app

---

## Validation Per App

For each app, verify:

- [ ] Directory structure matches standard (src/, tests/, etc.)
- [ ] `pip install -e .` succeeds
- [ ] `make fmt` runs successfully
- [ ] `make lint` passes
- [ ] `make test` passes (if tests exist)
- [ ] `make check` passes
- [ ] CLI entry point works: `tars-<app-name> --help`
- [ ] Docker build succeeds: `docker compose build <service>`
- [ ] README.md documents all MQTT topics
- [ ] .env.example lists all environment variables
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved (no behavior changes)

## Success Criteria

Migration complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All 13 apps follow standard structure
2. ‚úÖ All apps have functional Makefile with all targets
3. ‚úÖ All apps have comprehensive README.md
4. ‚úÖ All apps pass `make check`
5. ‚úÖ All apps build successfully in Docker
6. ‚úÖ Full stack runs without errors: `docker compose up`
7. ‚úÖ All MQTT contracts preserved and documented
8. ‚úÖ Documentation updated (main README, copilot instructions)

## Notes

- **[P] markers**: Tasks that can run in parallel (different apps/files)
- **[App] labels**: Track which app each task belongs to
- **Validation**: Each app must pass all checks before moving to next
- **Git workflow**: Commit after each app migration for easy rollback
- **Testing**: Test both standalone (`make check`) and Docker integration
- **Documentation**: README.md and .env.example are critical for each app
- **Priority order**: Designed to start with simple/isolated apps, end with critical router
