# Tasks: Centralized MQTT Client Module

**Feature Branch**: `004-centralize-mqtt-client`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-centralize-mqtt-client/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/mqtt_client_api.yaml

**TDD Mandate**: All implementation follows strict Test-Driven Development:
1. Write test FIRST (RED state - test fails)
2. Implement minimum code to pass (GREEN state)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. No implementation without corresponding test written first

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Documentation (Phase 6)**: Depends on User Story 1 (MVP) completion at minimum
- **Service Migrations (Phase 7)**: Depends on User Story 2 completion
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories and migrations complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1/US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story (TDD Workflow)

1. **Write Tests FIRST** (RED state)
   - All test tasks for the story
   - Run tests, verify they FAIL
   - Commit tests in failing state
2. **Implement Minimum Code** (GREEN state)
   - Implementation tasks
   - Run tests, verify they PASS
   - Commit implementation
3. **Refactor** (KEEP GREEN)
   - Improve code quality
   - Tests stay green
   - Commit refactorings

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 5 tasks can run in parallel (T001-T005)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: Sequential pairs for TDD:
- T006 (test) then T007 (impl) - ConnectionParams
- T008 (test) then T009 (impl) - MQTTClientConfig
- T010 (test) then T011 (impl) - HealthStatus/Heartbeat
- T012 (test) then T013 (impl) - MessageDeduplicator
- Pairs can run in parallel with each other

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:
- All test tasks T015-T020 can run in parallel (write all tests first)
- Implementation tasks T021-T027 sequential (same file)
- Documentation tasks T028-T030 can run in parallel after implementation

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- All test tasks T031-T035 can run in parallel
- Implementation tasks T036-T041 sequential (same file)
- Migration tasks T042-T043 can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks T044-T045 can run in parallel

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:
- All test tasks T046-T049 can run in parallel
- Implementation tasks T050-T053 sequential (same file)
- Documentation tasks T054-T056 can run in parallel

**Phase 6 (Documentation)**: All tasks T057-T062 can run in parallel, T063-T064 sequential after

**Phase 7 (Service Migrations)**: Tasks T065-T071 can all run in parallel (different services)

**Phase 8 (Polish)**: Tasks T075-T080 can all run in parallel, T081-T083 sequential after

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (TDD Workflow)

```bash
# Step 1: Write ALL tests first (parallel)
Task T015: "Write test for MQTTClient.__init__() validation [RED]"
Task T016: "Write test for MQTTClient.connect() success [RED]"
Task T017: "Write test for MQTTClient.connect() invalid URL [RED]"
Task T018: "Write test for MQTTClient.publish_event() wraps Envelope [RED]"
Task T019: "Write test for MQTTClient.subscribe() registers handler [RED]"
Task T020: "Write integration test for end-to-end publish/subscribe [RED]"

# Verify: Run pytest, all tests should FAIL (expected)

# Step 2: Implement sequentially to make tests pass (GREEN)
Task T021: "Implement MQTTClient.__init__() [GREEN]"  # Tests T015 pass
Task T022: "Implement MQTTClient.connect() [GREEN]"    # Tests T016-T017 pass
Task T024: "Implement MQTTClient.publish_event() [GREEN]"  # Test T018 passes
Task T025: "Implement MQTTClient.subscribe() [GREEN]"  # Test T019 passes
# ... continue until all tests pass

# Step 3: Refactor while keeping tests green
# Run pytest after each change to ensure no regressions
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Setup (parallel: T001-T005)
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Foundational (TDD pairs: T006-T014) - **CRITICAL BLOCKING PHASE**
3. **Complete Phase 3**: User Story 1 (TDD: tests T015-T020 first, then impl T021-T030)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: 
   - Run all tests: `pytest packages/tars-core/tests/`
   - Test User Story 1 acceptance: Create new test service with <10 LOC MQTT usage
   - Run quickstart scenario: Basic publish/subscribe example
5. **Deploy/Demo MVP**: Centralized client ready for new services

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation Ready** (Phase 1 + 2): Core models and infrastructure complete
2. **MVP Delivery** (+ Phase 3): New services can use centralized client - **SHIP IT**
3. **Migration Ready** (+ Phase 4): Existing services can migrate - **SHIP IT**
4. **Extension Ready** (+ Phase 5): Services can extend for custom use cases - **SHIP IT**
5. **Full Migration** (+ Phase 7): All services using centralized client
6. **Production Ready** (+ Phase 8): Optimized, documented, validated

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Phase 3) - Core client implementation
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Phase 4) - Migration support (starts after US1 T021-T027)
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Phase 5) - Extension patterns (starts after US1 T021-T027)
- **Developer D**: Documentation (Phase 6) - Can start in parallel with US2/US3

Stories complete and integrate independently.

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story]** label (US1, US2, US3) maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **[RED]** = Test written first, must fail before implementation
- **[GREEN]** = Implementation makes test pass
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD is mandatory**: Write tests BEFORE implementation for all entities
- Commit after each task or logical TDD cycle (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Constitution compliance validated at Phase 1 (T005) and Phase 8 (T081)
