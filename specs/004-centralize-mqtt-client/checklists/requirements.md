# Specification Quality Checklist: Centralized MQTT Client Module

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification is written from developer user perspective (appropriate for internal tooling). No implementation-specific details (e.g., no specific class names, file structures, or code patterns). Focus is on capabilities and behaviors.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 18 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous. Success criteria use measurable metrics (lines of code, percentage reduction, time to integrate). 8 edge cases identified covering connection, performance, and error scenarios. Out of scope section clearly bounds what won't be included.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three user stories with P1-P3 prioritization cover the complete developer journey: new service creation (P1), migration (P2), and extension (P3). Each story includes acceptance scenarios that map to functional requirements. Success criteria align with user story priorities.

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - Specification is ready for planning

**Summary**: 
- All mandatory sections completed
- 18 functional requirements defined
- 8 success criteria with measurable outcomes
- 3 prioritized user stories with independent test criteria
- 8 edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries defined
- No implementation details in specification
- No clarifications needed (all patterns well-understood from existing codebase)

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan.
